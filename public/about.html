    <h2 class="highlight"> Hello !!!</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <a href="https://www.pronouncenames.com/search?name=Prashant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prashant Sharma</a>. 
      I'm 35 years old Software developer. I am from India and recently moved to Calgary, Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      I come from a small city called <span class="highlight">Jhansi</span>, it is a quite city in northern part of <span class="highlight">India</span>. I did my schooling there, then in 2007 I moved to <span class="highlight">Delhi</span> for my graduation. <br />
      I completed my Bachelor's in Engineering in 2011. From collage I landed my first job at <span class="highlight">Samsung Electronics</span> as an APP developer. 
      Then came the era of <span class="highlight" style="color: yellowgreen">smart-phones :P</span>, and eventually I moved to Android development. I worked for 10 years in Samsung and it was a great experience.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then in 2021 I joined <span class="highlight">Blue Yonder</span> as a Full Stack developer. My journey with blue yonder was short but it was full of challenges. I worked there till February of 2023, then I resigned to move to Canada.
